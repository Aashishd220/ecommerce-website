# Backend

## API Contracts 
## Database Schema
## How to run
## Test results

# Frontend 

## Homepage
## Products Page
## Connectivity with Backend
- After bringing front end and back end servers up and running, we connected both ends by calling Get all products API from homepage
- Back end data is retreived successfully by front end but for now we are showing only dummy data 
## Redux Setup
## Test results 

## Note
- On Feb 4, we squashed many commits due to which some of our commits lost their history. User stories closing date will give an idea of our actual commit history.
- Due to git email config issue faced earlier, some commits are shown in two different commit history bar graphs.
